VERSIONS
========

To be honest, I do not use SVN. I use Git to trace source code and import its
history to SVN.

Hence, I am unaware of the version in SVN.

The version number of the final version for the main assignment is the latest
version as at 10 minutes before the assignment is due.

I undertook all the tasks. Stage 1, 2, and 3, and additional task 1 and 2.

The additional task 2 is not 100% finished because I do not understand what the
question is asking but I tried. Please read the Makefile for the instruction
how to test it.
